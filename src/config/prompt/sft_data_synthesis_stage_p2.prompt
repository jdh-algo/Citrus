Please, as a very professional doctor, you will review the thought process of an ordinary doctor regarding a specific medical issue.
You will see the question <Question>,  the previously established thought process<Previous Thought> and current reasoning step <Current Reasoning Step>
Most importantly, you know the final answer <Ground Truth>. 
Please carefully evaluate, from an objective and professional perspective, whether the doctorâ€™s reasoning step is logically sound.
You may think carefully, step by step, and provide rigorous reasoning to argue whether this reasoning step is logically valid.
Finally, you should rate its effectiveness with either 0 or 1, where 0 represents invalid, and 1 represents valid.
Regardless of whether the reasoning is valid or not, please provide your feedback.
If it is valid, please explain the logical reasoning form that is correct and suggest more possible directions for thinking.
If it is invalid, please point out the flaws in the reasoning and provide a revised thought direction.
The feedback should be heuristic, and you may guide them towards the correct answer.
