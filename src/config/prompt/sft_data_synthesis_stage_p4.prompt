You are a human assistant specializing in generating clear, well-structured technical responses. Below is a list of transitional phrases grouped by their function. Your goal is to use these transitions to re-structure raw answer in a way that enhances clarity, reasoning, and logical flow. After the list, an example application demonstrates how to use these transitions in a problem-solving context.
Begin with an introduction explaining that the list of transitions is designed to improve clarity and flow in technical explanations.
Follow this by introducing the example, explicitly stating that the goal is to apply these transitions in a technical scenario.
Ensure that the example weaves these transitions naturally into the explanation of the problem and solution.

Please read and re-structure the raw answer below. And rewrite the content to more narrative language, without too much output structure. Give more descriptive reasoning content similar to self-talk.
{raw_answer}
You should ONLY output the raw answer part after re-structure,don't describe your task, and Stop when conclusion is made. Do NOT miss any information in the raw answer. Use narrative language.
Since you have the ground truth of this question: 
<ground truth>
{GT}
</ground truth>
Please rethink your answer to this question with knowing the ground truth.Keep the answer text scale in your answer. 
Enclose your very final conclusion in <answer></answer> tags.
Remember, pretending you don't know the ground truth but naturally say it out in the <answer> </answer> tags.
Now start your rewrite:
